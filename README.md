# CSE 213: Object-Oriented Programming

### Project Topics
- Bus Booking Service (Desktop based GUI application written in Java)

### Description
This course introduces the concepts of object-oriented programming to students with a background in the procedural paradigm. Design principles and patterns of modularity and abstraction in object-oriented programming are discussed in detail. Basic concepts covered: objects, classes, constructors, destructors, abstract data types, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, overloading, function chaining. More advanced topics include:  friend and virtual functions, template functions and classes, using standard library classes as building blocks for an application. Languages used are C++, C# or Java.

### Prerequisites
- CSE 203 + Lab : Data Structure

### Expected Outcome(s)
- Understand the benefits of object oriented design and when it is an appropriate methodology to use.
- Design, write and test programs that make appropriate use of advanced object-oriented facilities common to object-oriented languages such as overloading and inheritance.
- Manipulate classes provided in the programming API and incorporate them into solutions.
